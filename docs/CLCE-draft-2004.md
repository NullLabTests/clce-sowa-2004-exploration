# Common Logic Controlled English (CLCE)
**Draft – 24 February 2004**  
John F. Sowa

## Abstract (transcribed excerpt)
Common Logic Controlled English (CLCE) is a formal language with an English-like syntax. Anyone who can read ordinary English can read sentences in CLCE with little or no training. Writing CLCE, however, requires practice in learning to stay within its syntactic and semantic limitations.

Formally, CLCE supports full first-order logic with equality supplemented with an ontology for sets, sequences, and integers.

## Classic examples
Every cat is on a mat.

Some person is between a rock and a hard place.

If some person x is the mother of a person y,
then y is a child of x.

Every person has some person as mother.

For every prime number x,
there is a prime number greater than x.

Mary gives a dog a very juicy steak from a hot pan.
